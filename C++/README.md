## Observer in C++

> **Observer** is a behavioral design pattern that allows some objects to notify other objects about changes in their state.

The Observer pattern provides a way to subscribe and unsubscribe to and from these events for any object that implements a subscriber interface.

---c++

### Usage of the pattern in C++

**Usage examples**: The Observer pattern is pretty common in C++ code, especially in the GUI components. It provides a way to react to events happening in other objects without coupling to their classes.

**Identification**: The pattern can be recognized by subscription methods, that store objects in a list and by calls to the update method issued to objects in that list.

### Conceptual Example

This example illustrates the structure of the **Observer** design pattern. It focuses on answering these questions:

- What classes does it consist of?
- What roles do these classes play?
- In what way the elements of the pattern are related?

#### main.cc: Conceptual example

```
/**
 * Observer Design Pattern
 *
 * Intent: Lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects
 * about any events that happen to the object they're observing.
 *
 * Note that there's a lot of different terms with similar meaning associated
 * with this pattern. Just remember that the Subject is also called the
 * Publisher and the Observer is often called the Subscriber and vice versa.
 * Also the verbs "observe", "listen" or "track" usually mean the same thing.
